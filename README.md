# Things to do:

## Milestone 5: 
### Requirements
* Include third party web service - Facebook Log in, change the database to include authentication information (store data per user so that you can only see the signed-in user's light shows)
* Improved Functionality - Chasing, Blinking, and Randomized pattern (the radio buttons for this are set as not visible), this will include changes to the code.py file on the raspberry pi, these changes should result in a change in the json sent to the pi (Most likely including Chasing, Blinking, and Randomized like Propagated is currently in the JSON)
* Improved UI - IP address should be stored in Settings (the upper right drop down menu)

### Submission - Tuesday 11:55pm, November 25th
* A zip of the android project
* A .apk of the project posted to plato, this is found in the the app folder inside the project folder and is called 'app-release.apk' (Make sure it is using API 15)
